/**
 * Workaround an issue with PathVariables.
 * 
 * Most of the controllers use a @RequestMapping like /circuits/{id}/extend.
 * 
 * But a circuit id can itself have a slash, an id of abc/def resuls in /circuits/abc/def/extend which doesn't match the
 * mapping.
 * 
 * This is handled, as usual, by escaping the reserved characters such that / becomes %2F when rendering the page (just
 * as a space becomes %20) @see URLEncoder
 * 
 * This PostProcessor tells spring not to decode the %2F until after it has looked up the handler mapping, so
 * /circuits/{id}/extend will match /circuits/abc%2Fdef/extend (but wouldn't match the decoded /circuits/abc/def/extend
